 * Styles can also influence the visibility of interactions within a network-based application by restricting interfaces via generality or providing access to monitoring. Visibility in this case refers to the ability of a component to monitor or mediate the interaction between two other components. Visibility can enable improved performance via shared caching of interactions, scalability through layered services, reliability through reflective monitoring, and security by allowing the interactions to be inspected by mediators (e.g., network firewalls). The mobile agent style is an example where the lack of visibility may lead to security concerns.
 * This usage of the term visibility differs from that in Ghezzi et al. [58], where they are referring to visibility into the development process rather than the product.
