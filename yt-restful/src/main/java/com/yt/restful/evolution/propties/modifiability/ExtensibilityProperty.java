 * ExtensibilityProperty is defined as the ability to add functionality to a system [108]. Dynamic extensibility implies that functionality can be added to a deployed system without impacting the rest of the system. ExtensibilityProperty is induced within an architectural style by reducing the coupling between components, as exemplified by event-based integration.
