 * 简单性
 * The primary means by which architectural styles induce simplicity is by applying the principle of separation of concerns to the allocation of functionality within components. If functionality can be allocated such that the individual components are substantially less complex, then they will be easier to understand and implement. Likewise, such separation eases the task of reasoning about the overall architecture. I have chosen to lump the qualities of complexity, understandability, and verifiability under the general property of simplicity, since they go hand-in-hand for a network-based system.

 Applying the principle of generality to architectural elements also improves simplicity, since it decreases variation within an architecture. Generality of connectors leads to middleware [22].
