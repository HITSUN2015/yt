 * ReusabilityProperty is a property of an application architecture if its components, connectors, or data elements can be reused, without modification, in other applications. The primary mechanisms for inducing reusability within architectural styles is reduction of coupling (knowledge of identity) between components and constraining the generality of component interfaces. The uniform pipe-and-filter style exemplifies these types of constraints.
