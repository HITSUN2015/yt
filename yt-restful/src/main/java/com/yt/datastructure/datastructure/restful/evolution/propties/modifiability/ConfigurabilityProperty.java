 * ConfigurabilityProperty is related to both extensibility and reusability in that it refers to post-deployment modification of components, or configurations of components, such that they are capable of using a new service or data element type. The pipe-and-filter and code-on-demand styles are two examples that induce configurability of configurations and components, respectively.
